There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Vegetate is a web application that allows users to keep track the freshness of produce. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  For the busy, adventurous cook who buys lotus root because they like the yoga position.

## Summary ##
  Vegetate makes it possible to see whats in the refrigerator wherever you are, and more importanly determine when those items will spoil to better plan meals. 

## Problem ##
  Food spoilage is huge problem. We want to eat healthy, but until we genetically engineer tomatoes to have a shelf life of 6 months we need to teach ourselves to be more concious of whats in the fridge. Or we could just have an app that does it for us.

## Solution ##
  By keeping track of when the produce was bought and estimating spoilage rate the user can see when their produce goes bad.

## Quote from You ##
  This is the year we stop finding zuchini carcauses in the back of our produce drawer.

## How to Get Started ##
  Its as simple as signing up on the website.  You don't need to verify an email address because I hate that crap, but you should because it makes it easier for us to contact you.

## Customer Quote ##
  Joe from I made this guy up said "I had no idea just how much food I was wasting until I saw a log of all my spoiled food. I'm still wasting a crap ton of food, but at least now I'm conscious of it."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
